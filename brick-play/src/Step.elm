{-| The move step Brick Play uses for keyboard nudges, the context ring's moves
and body drags. It is the segmented control in the ring (Stud, ½ stud, Bit):

  - `Stud`: 20 LDU sideways and 24 LDU (one brick) up or down. The default.
  - `HalfStud`: 10 LDU sideways and 8 LDU (one plate) up or down, a deliberate
    half-stud offset.
  - `Bit`: 1 LDU on every axis, the fine move that Shift gives for a single key
    or drag.

`apply` writes the choice into the studio (`Studio.Core.setNudgeSteps` and
`setFineMove`), so keys, the ring and body drags all follow it. The choice lives
in Brick Play's model and persists across selections.
