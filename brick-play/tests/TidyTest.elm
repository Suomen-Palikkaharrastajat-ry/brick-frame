module TidyTest exposing (suite)

{-| Tidy up in Brick Play: the pill shows only for a build with problems and
counts its loose parts; the preview is modal (editing paused); Apply moves the
parts as one undo step; Cancel and Escape change nothing; glued parts stay put;
and every example of docs/examples.md is healthy (no pill).
