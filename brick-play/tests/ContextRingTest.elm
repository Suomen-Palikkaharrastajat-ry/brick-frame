module ContextRingTest exposing (suite)

{-| Tests for Brick Play's context ring: how it opens and closes, its buttons and
their accessible names, the W A S D Q E moves (with and without a selection, and
in Walk mode), the move steps, Tab selection, and the first-select hint.

Moves are checked in render space (Y up, the camera's frame) against the snapping
the studio uses: the camera's azimuth snapped to the nearest world axis.
