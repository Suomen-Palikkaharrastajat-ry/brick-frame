{-| Which parts Brick Contraptions draws turning, and which static copies it
hides while it does.

The turning parts are drawn by the shared `Simulation` component: the gears
(`Simulation.gearEntitiesFor`), one baked mesh per gear rotated about its own
axle, and the driven parts riding on them (`Simulation.drivenEntitiesFor`) —
axles a gear sits on and parts threaded onto a gear's axle. The studio's
instanced scene still holds every one of those placements, so while the machine
is animated their placements are hidden from it (`Viewport.setHiddenSources`);
otherwise the static copy would show through the moving one. Gears outside the
motor's gear train, and axles no turning gear drives, are neither animated nor
hidden: they stay in the static scene.

placements (viewport sources) hidden from the static scene because those
turning parts stand in for them.

{-| The machine is shown turning while it plays, and also while it is paused
part-way (time > 0), so a pause freezes the gears where they are. At time 0 the
gears sit exactly where the static parts are, so the static scene shows them.

{-| From the gears that turn with the motor (`Simulation.rotatingGearIds`), the
placement of each gear, and the placement of each driven part paired with its
driving gear (`Placements.partSources`) — the gears to animate, and the
placements to hide: the gears' own placements, plus the driven parts whose
driving gear is animated. A gear without a main-model placement is not animated.
